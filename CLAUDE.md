# bear-sync

Monorepo with two Go binaries for syncing Bear notes with external consumers.

## Project Structure

- cmd/hub/ — API server (runs on VPS)
- cmd/bridge/ — Mac agent that reads Bear SQLite and syncs with hub
- internal/models/ — shared data models (Note, Tag, Attachment, Backlink, WriteQueueItem)
- internal/mapper/ — Bear SQLite → Hub model mapping
- internal/beardb/ — Bear SQLite reader (bridge only)
- internal/hubclient/ — HTTP client for hub API (bridge only)
- internal/store/ — SQLite store for hub (hub only)
- internal/api/ — HTTP handlers with chi router (hub only)
- internal/xcallback/ — Bear x-callback-url executor via xcall CLI (bridge only)
- deploy/ — deployment configs (systemd unit, launchd plist, Caddyfile)
- testdata/ — test fixtures (test Bear SQLite)

## Commands

- make build — build both binaries to bin/
- make test — run all tests
- make test-coverage — run tests with coverage report
- make test-race — run tests with race detector
- make lint — run golangci-lint
- make fmt — format code (gofumpt + goimports)
- make tidy — go mod tidy
- make generate — run go generate (moq)

## After Making Changes

Run these checks before committing (in order):

1. `make fmt` — format code
2. `make lint` — run linter, fix all warnings
3. `make test` — ensure all tests pass
4. `make test-race` — ensure no data races
5. `make test-coverage` — ensure coverage does not decrease compared to the main branch
6. `make tidy` — update go.mod/go.sum if dependencies changed
7. If interfaces changed: `make generate` — regenerate mocks

## Code Patterns

- Interface-first design for testability (Store, BearDB, HubClient, XCallback)
- Mocks via moq with //go:generate directives
- Structured logging with log/slog
- context.Context in all external operations
- Error wrapping: fmt.Errorf("message: %w", err)
- Configuration via environment variables (no config files)
- Tests with github.com/stretchr/testify (assert/require)
- Line length limit: 140 characters
- SQLite via modernc.org/sqlite (pure Go, no CGO)

## Database

- Hub uses SQLite with WAL mode, busy_timeout=5000, foreign_keys=ON
- Dual-ID pattern: hub UUID (PK) + bear_id (Bear's UUID, nullable, UNIQUE)
- FTS5 for full-text search on notes (title + body)

## Sync Architecture

- Bear is source-of-truth for user content
- Hub is read replica + write queue for external consumers
- Write flow: consumer → hub write_queue → bridge lease → xcall to Bear → ack
- Read flow: Bear → bridge delta export → hub sync/push → consumer API
- Delivery: effectively-once (consumer→hub), at-least-once (hub→bridge), duplicate-safe (bridge apply)

## Auth

- Multiple consumer Bearer tokens (api/* scope) configured via `HUB_CONSUMER_TOKENS`, plus one bridge token (sync/* scope)
- Each consumer is identified by name and authenticated with its own token
- Write queue items are attributed to the originating consumer via `consumer_id`
- Encrypted notes are read-only (403 for write operations)
- All mutating consumer API requests (POST/PUT/DELETE) require an `Idempotency-Key` header; missing header returns HTTP 400

## Note sync_status lifecycle

- `synced`: normal state; Bear delta pushes overwrite hub fields freely
- `pending_to_bear`: a consumer has enqueued a write; hub will NOT overwrite `title`/`body` from Bear delta pushes while in this state
- `conflict`: set when a Bear push arrives for a `pending_to_bear` note with a newer `modified_at`; bridge creates a `[Conflict] Title` note in Bear instead of applying the queue item
- Transitions: `synced` → `pending_to_bear` (on enqueue) → `synced` (on ack with "applied") or `conflict` (on conflicting Bear push)

## Database

- Bear SQLite uses Core Data epoch timestamps (float64 seconds since 2001-01-01)
- Conversion: `unix_ts = core_data_ts + 978307200` (defined as `mapper.CoreDataEpochOffset`)

## Bridge State

- State file: `~/.bear-bridge-state.json` (path overridable via `BRIDGE_STATE_PATH`)
- `last_sync_at`: Core Data epoch (float64, NOT Unix epoch) — used as `>= lastSyncAt` delta read threshold
- `junction_full_scan_counter`: incremented every cycle; triggers full junction table scan every 12 cycles (`junctionFullScanInterval`)
- `known_*_ids`: Bear UUIDs seen on last sync; diffed against current Bear DB to produce `deleted_*_ids` in push requests
- Absent state file → initial sync (full export in 50-note batches); state written atomically (write to `.tmp` then `rename`)
